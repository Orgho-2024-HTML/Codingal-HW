            <p>It has a perfect combination of balacned diet including fried egg, chicken, sauced 
                vegetables and a huge amount of rice

            <h1>My 3rd fav food is Korean Ramen</h1>
            <p>It's very spicy noodles made by some Korean rice [i think :)] and it has egg, vegetables
                and chicken. Though I don't like very spicy food but still I love Ramen
